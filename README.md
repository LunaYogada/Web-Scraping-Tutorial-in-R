# Web Scraping Tutorial Using R with Examples

Table of Contents:



## Introduction

As a typical R user, most of the times, I don't care too much about the details and I only want to find something that works. However, by the time I wrote this tutorial, I found many materials on the internet about web-scraping using R were out-dated, and it made my life very hard. So after I read tons of blogs, Stack Overflow answers and package documents, I think I need to creates tutorials to make your lives much easier.
