# Web Scraping Tutorial Using R with Examples

**(In progress)**

## Introduction

As a typical R user, most of the times, I don't care too much about the details, and I only want to find something easy and works. However, by the time I wrote this tutorial, I found many materials on the internet about web-scraping using R were out-dated, and it made my life very hard. So after I read tons of blogs, Stack Overflow answers, and package documents, I think I need to create tutorials to make your lives much more comfortable.

## Some Fundamentals

+ Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript is preferable but not required
+ Understanding of basic R
+ Required packages(tidyverse, stringr, rvest, RSelenium, seleniumPipes)
+ Required gadgets(CSS SelectorGadget, chrome)
